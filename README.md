# FizzBuzz
## Overview
This simple Python program implements the classic "FizzBuzz" game. It's a common programming challenge and often used in coding interviews. The program prints the numbers from 1 to a user-defined limit, but for multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, it prints "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz."

# Usage
1. Run the program.
2. When prompted, enter a positive integer. This will be the upper limit for the FizzBuzz sequence.
3. The program will then print the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to the number you entered.

# How it Works
The program uses a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 up to the number entered by the user. For each number, it checks:

* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz."
* If the number is only divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz."
* If the number is only divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz."
* If none of the above conditions are met, it prints the number itself.
  
# Note
This program is for educational purposes and demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
